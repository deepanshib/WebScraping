# WebScraping
Using BeautifulSoup

Web scraping or crawling is the process of fetching data from a third-party website by downloading and parsing the HTML/XML code.

BeautifulSoup is a python library for web scrapping and pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
It works with parsers to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
Installing BeautifulSoup -
       $pip3 install BeautifulSoup4

Out of various use cases, in this Github repository, I have taken 3 simple examples - 

1. Fetching data from Wikipedia on Entreprenuership
2. Using LinkedIn API to get results on interested job openings
3. Comparing top prices of speakers on available on Amazon

During this project, I have faced a lot of issues which shows how complex web scraping could turn out to be and hence there has been a shift from web scraping to APIs.
There are challenges while using BeautifulSoup due to which it is often used with other libraries.
Please refer the attached powerpoint presentation for more details.
